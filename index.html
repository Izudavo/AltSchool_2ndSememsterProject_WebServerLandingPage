        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect with a strong foundation in software development, DevOps, and video editing.
            <br>Proficient in designing and implementing scalable cloud solutions using AWS services, deploying containerized applications, and managing CI/CD pipelines.
            <br>Driven by a passion for learning, I earned my certifications in November and December, reflecting my commitment to advancing in cloud engineering and DevOps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Respect to AltSchool Africa, where I first encountered the term "Cloud Engineering."
            Initially enrolling to study "Backend Engineering," my time at AltSchool sparked a deeper interest in cloud technologies, inspiring me to pivot and pursue this exciting path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I seek to leverage my skills and certifications to contribute to innovative cloud engineering and DevOps projects.
        </p>
        <p>Fun fact: I have a nickname: Izudavo- The "Izu" comes from Izuchukwu(middle name), while "dav" is from David(first name), and the "O" stands for Obinta(Surname)
            <br>Outside of Tech, I'm a Video Editor, driven to create creative visuals for users entertainment.
        <p>Also i'm currently a 300level student studying Biomedical Technology at Federal University of Technology, Akure.(FUTA)
